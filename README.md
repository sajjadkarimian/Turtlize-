# Turtlize-
a lightweight Python tool designed to convert metadata from Excel spreadsheets into RDF Turtle (.ttl) files. It enables seamless translation of tabular metadata into semantic formats aligned with FAIR data principles and linked data standards.

Modify the Excel file according to your requirements, make adjustments in the Python file, and it will generate your metadata.
Then you can use the  turtle file with WidoCo to create documentation as well.
